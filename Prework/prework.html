                I am a student at Texas State University at San Marcos and my
                major is Computer Science. I was born and raise in Cameroon, Africa
                and I moved to the United States in 2015 in search for a better life and education.
                I hope to accomplish my dreams in this country and make my family proud. I love to watch
                and play soccer, travel, code, and make friends. I hope with this internship I will gain
                the necessary skills to be successful in my career as a Software Engineer.
